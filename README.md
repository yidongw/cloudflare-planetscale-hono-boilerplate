# RESTful API Boilerplate

A boilerplate/starter project for quickly building RESTful APIs using [Hono](https://honojs.dev/), and Drizzle. Inspired by
[node-express-boilerplate](https://github.com/hagopj13/node-express-boilerplate) by hagopj13.

## Features

- **SQL database**: Drizzle
- **Authentication and authorization**: using JWT
- **Validation**: request data validation using [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
- **Logging**: using [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)
- **Testing**: unit and integration tests using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- **Error handling**: centralised error handling mechanism provided by [Hono](https://honojs.dev/)
- **Git hooks**: with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
- **Linting**: with [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- **Emails**: with [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/)
- **Oauth**: Support for Discord, Github, Spotify, Google, Apple and Facebook. Support coming for
  Instagram and Twitter
- **Rate Limiting**: using Cloudflare durable objects you can rate limit endpoints usin the sliding
  window algorithm

## Setup

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in the values
You will need it for running the migration.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Copy .env.test.example to .env.test and fill in the values.
You will need it for running the tests.

```bash
cp .env.test.example .env.test
```

Start Postgres locally
You will need it for running the tests.

```bash
docker run --name=postgres --rm -itd -p 5432:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=test \
  postgres:latest \
  postgres -c 'max_connections=1000'
```

Generate Drizzle Queries

```bash
npm run generate
```

Migrate

```bash
npm run migrate
```

Run a specific test

```bash
bunx vitest run tests/integration/index.test.ts
```

## Commands

Running locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Testing:

TODO: when do npm run tests, they will fail

```bash
# run all tests
npm run tests

# run test coverage
npm run tests:coverage
```

Linting:

```bash
# run ESLint
npm run lint

# fix ESLint errors
npm run lint:fix

# run prettier
npm run prettier

# fix prettier errors
npm run prettier:fix
```

## Error Handling

The app has a centralized error handling mechanism provided by [Hono](https://honojs.dev/).

```javascript
app.onError(errorHandler)
```

All errors will be caught by the errorHandler which converts the error to an ApiError and formats
it in a JSON response. Any errors that aren't intentionally thrown, e.g. 500 errors, are logged to
Sentry.

The error handling middleware sends an error response, which has the following format:

```json
{
  "code": 404,
  "message": "Not found"
}
```

When running in development mode, the error response also contains the error stack.

## Validation

Request data is validated using [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).

The validation schemas are defined in the `src/validations` directory and are used in the
controllers by getting either the query or body and then calling the parse on the relevant
validation function:

```javascript
const getUsers: Handler<{ Bindings: Bindings }> = async (c) => {
  const config = getConfig(env(c))
  const queryParse = c.req.query()
  const query = userValidation.getUsers.parse(queryParse)
  const filter = { email: query.email }
  const options = { sortBy: query.sort_by, limit: query.limit, page: query.page }
  const result = await userService.queryUsers(filter, options)
  return c.json(result, httpStatus.OK)
}
```

## Authentication

To require authentication for certain routes, you can use the `auth` middleware.

```javascript
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import * as userController from '../controllers/user.controller'
import { auth } from '../middlewares/auth'

const route = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>()

route.post('/', auth(), userController.createUser)

export { route }

```

These routes require a valid JWT access token in the Authorization request header using the Bearer
schema. If the request does not contain a valid access token, an Unauthorized (401) error is thrown.

## Emails

Support for Email sending using [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/). Just call the `sendEmail`
function in `src/services/email.service.ts`:

```javascript
const sendResetPasswordEmail = async (email: string, emailData: EmailData, config: Config) => {
  const message = {
    Subject: {
      Data: 'Reset your password',
      Charset: 'UTF-8'
    },
    Body: {
      Text: {
        Charset: 'UTF-8',
        Data: `
          Hello ${emailData.name}
          Please reset your password by clicking the following link:
          ${emailData.token}
        `
      }
    }
  }
  await sendEmail(email, config.email.sender, message, config.aws)
}
```

## Authorisation

The `auth` middleware can also be used to require certain rights/permissions to access a route.

```javascript
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import * as userController from '../controllers/user.controller'
import { auth } from '../middlewares/auth'

const route = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings }>()

route.post('/', auth('manageUsers'), userController.createUser)

export { route }
```

In the example above, an authenticated user can access this route only if that user has the
`manageUsers` permission.

The permissions are role-based. You can view the permissions/rights of each role in the
`src/config/roles.ts` file.

If the user making the request does not have the required permissions to access this route, a
Forbidden (403) error is thrown.

## Rate Limiting

To apply rate limits for certain routes, you can use the `rateLimit` middleware.

```javascript
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { auth } from '../middlewares/auth'
import { rateLimit } from '../middlewares/rateLimiter'

export const route = new Hono()

const twoMinutes = 120
const oneRequest = 1

route.post(
  '/send-verification-email',
  auth(),
  rateLimit(twoMinutes, oneRequest),
  authController.sendVerificationEmail
)
```

This uses Cloudflare durable objects to apply rate limits using the sliding window algorithm. You
can specify the interval size in seconds and how many requests are allowed per interval.

If the rate limit is hit a `429` will be returned to the client.

These headers are returned with each endpoint that has rate limiting applied:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit` - How many requests are allowed per window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset` - How many seconds until the current window resets
- `X-RateLimit-Policy` - Details about the rate limit policy in this format `${limit};w=${interval};comment="Sliding window"`
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining` - How many requests you can send until you will be rate limited. Please
  note this doesn't just reset to the limit when the reset period hits. Use it as indicator of your
  current throughput e.g. if you have 12 requests allowed every 1 second and remaining is 0
  you are at 100% throughput, but if it is 6 you are 50% throughput. This value constantly changes
  as the window progresses either increasing or decreasing based on your throughput

The rate limit will be based on IP unless the user is authenticated then it will be based on the
user ID.
